These files contain a collection of IIIF's that are formed into a IIIF itself.
This is used for the Mirador Visualizer in chapter 4 of the project about Europeana and teapots.
The IIIF has a weblink that is used in the html script to automatically load in the collection of teapots into Mirador Viewer.
